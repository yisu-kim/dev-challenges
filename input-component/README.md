# Input Component

`Front-end` `Design system`

## Challenge

Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

## User story

- I can see error state
- I can choose to disable input
- I can choose to have helper text
- I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- I can have different input sizes
- I can have different colors
- I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
- I can have multiline input like a `textarea`
- When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- I can still access all input attribute
- (optional) Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
